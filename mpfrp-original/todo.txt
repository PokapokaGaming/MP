- Check parties in io declaration at the beginning match
those in node definition.

- For a sink and a dependent source, if they belong to the
same party and there are nodes belonging to other party on
the path, request message doesn't work (perhaps such codes
should be prohibited).

- Currently, different parties in a program cannot be
treated as the same party in the instance program. It is
necessary to fix generated code (mainly args of modules)
by using set or other.
  ex)
  a.xfrp
  ------------------------
  module A
  party a1, a2, a3
  in src
  out dst
  ...
  ------------------------
  inst.xfrp
  ------------------------
  module Inst
  ❌(nn) = A{p, q, p}(nn)
  ------------------------
